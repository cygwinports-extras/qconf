sdesc: "Creates configure scripts for QMake-based projects"
ldesc: "QConf allows you to have a nice configure script for your 
qmake-based project. It is intended for developers who don't need (or 
want) to use the more complex GNU autotools. With qconf/qmake, it is 
easy to maintain a cross-platform project that uses a familiar 
configuration interface on unix."
